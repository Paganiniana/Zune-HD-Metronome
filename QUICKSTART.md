# Quickstart

It's been a long time since any of these packages have been updated. However, the last build of this application is included in the director <strong>/build/www</strong>. Therefore, you can run a simple server in that directory and experience the application, on your local machine.

```
$ cd build/www/

$ npx http-server .
```

The command <strong>npx http-server .</strong> will start a simple node-based server from the directory in which it runs.
